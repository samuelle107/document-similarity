The humans beat the machine.  One card written by the computer reads, "Kim Kardashian, but with spider legs."  This is a test.  I am adding some filler text.
In the typical Cards against Humanity fashion, the company presented a pretty funny FAQ.  They explained the questions you might have about the stunt.  This is the best board game.  Buyers no longer need worry, the humans win!  Cards Against Humanity is famous!
The nature outside is kind of cool.
