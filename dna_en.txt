[V:]
At first sight, I could recognize you
As if we were calling for each other
The DNA in my blood vessels tell me
That it's you I was looking all over for

[J-Hope, Rap Monster:]
Our meeting is like a mathematical formula
Commandments of religion, providence of the universe;
The evidence of destiny given to me
You're the source of my dream
Take it, take it
My hand reaching out to you is my chosen fate

[Jungkook, Jin:]
Don't worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We're totally different, baby
Because we're the two who found our destiny

[Jimin:]
From the day of the universe's creation and beyond
Through the infinite centuries and beyond
In the previous life and maybe the next too
We're eternally together

[Jungkook:]
None of this is a coincidence
Because we're the two who found our destiny
DNA

[Suga, Rap Monster:]
I want it this love I want it real love
I only focus on you
You steer me a little harder
The DNA of the genesis wants you
This is inevitable, I love us
We are the only true lovers

[Suga, Jimin, Jungkook:]
Every time I see her, I freak out
Surprisingly, I keep gasping and it's weird, maybe
This is the emotion they call love
Because from the very beginning, my heart runs to you

[Jin:]
Don't worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We're totally different, baby
Because we're the two who found our destiny

[Jungkook, Jimin:]
From the day of the universe's creation and beyond
Through the infinite centuries and beyond
In the previous life and maybe the next too
We're eternally together

None of this is a coincidence
Because we're the two who found our destiny
DNA

[V, Jin, Jungkook, Jimin:]
Don't look back
Because we're the two who found our destiny
Don't regret it, baby
Because we're forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever
We are together

[Jimin, Jungkook:]
Don't worry, love
None of this is a coincidence
We're totally different, baby
Because we're the two who found our destiny

[J-Hope, Jungkook:]
La la la la la
La la la la la
Because it's not a coincidence
La la la la la
La la la la la
Because it's not a coincidence
DNA
