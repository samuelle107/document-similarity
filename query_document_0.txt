In this special, an homage to Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, Nature Cat is bursting with what he thinks is "Christmas spirit," and wants to celebrate with lots of presents for himself, and by decorating the woods with bright lights and loud festive music for everyone. Daisy, Hal and Squeeks are upset because Nature Cat's desire to celebrate Christmas in a big way is causing problems with their friendship, as well as bothering all of the animals in the woods. It’s not until Nature Cat is visited by three Christmas Spirits—the spirits of Nature Past (Daisy, voiced by Kate Micucci), Present (Squeeks) and Future (Hal)—that he finally sees the true meaning of Christmas.

Nature Cat centers on house cat Fred, a dreamer of the great outdoors. Once his family leaves for the day, Fred becomes Nature Cat with the help of his animal friends, embarks on action-packed adventures that allow him to explore the natural world. Another SNL star voicing a character in the series is Kenan Thompson (Ronald).
